# ⏱️ Aesthetic Glassmorphism Stopwatch

A sleek, high-precision web-based stopwatch featuring a **Glassmorphism** design. This project combines a modern "frosted glass" aesthetic with a custom color palette and a playful, rounded interface.

## ✨ Features

* **Precision Timing**: Tracks time down to the centisecond (1/100th of a second).
* **Glassmorphism UI**: Uses `backdrop-filter` for a blurred-glass effect, soft shadows, and translucent borders.
* **Dynamic Button States**: The interface intelligently enables and disables the **Start**, **Stop**, and **Reset** buttons based on the timer's current state.
* **Responsive Design**: The UI scales fluidly for mobile devices using media queries and flexible widths.
* **Aesthetic Typography**: Features high-quality Google Fonts including `Fredoka One` for a fun, bold look and `Roboto Mono` for precise time alignment.
* **Keyboard Friendly**: Accessible design with ARIA roles and labels for screen readers.
